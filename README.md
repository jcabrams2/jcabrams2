### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jon!

I'm currently working on my Full Stack Java course at WeCanCodeIT
- I'm currently learning:

- Java
- Vanilla Java concepts and development
- Test Driven Development
- Object Oriented Programming

- HTML5
- CSS
- Spring Framework MVC

- JS
- JQuery

I'm looking to callaborate/network with other students and developers.


Fun Fact: I have been riding/racing dirtbikes for about 20 years, which was my first passion and still is a major part of my life to this day. 

*Goals for 2021: Graduate from WeCanCodeIT and find my first job as a Full Stack Java Developer. I'd like to plant myself with a company that I can grow, learn, and progress with long term in my new career field.
