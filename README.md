### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jon!

I'm currently working on my Full Stack Java course at WeCanCodeIT
I'm currently learning about arrays, constructors, etc. in Java
I'm looking to callaborate/network with other students and developers.
Fun Fact: I have been riding/racing dirtbikes for about 20 years, which was my first passion and still is a major part of my life to this day. 

Goals for 2021: Graduate from WeCanCodeIT and find my first job as a Full Stack Java Developer. I'd like to plant myself with a company that I can grow,learn, and progress with long term in my new career field.
