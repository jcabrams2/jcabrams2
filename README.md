### Hi there 👋 I'm Jon!

I'm currently working on my Full Stack Java course at WeCanCodeIT
I'm currently learning about arrays, constructors, etc. in Java
I'm looking to callaborate/network with other students and developers.
Fun Fact: I have been riding/racing dirtbikes for about 20 years, which was my first passion and still is a major part of my life to this day.
